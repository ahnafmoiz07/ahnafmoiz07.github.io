                  <h3> A Beginner Web Developer </h3>
                  <p>Hi Guys! I am a beginner web developer. I am a student of St.Joseph Higher Secondary School in
                        Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am only 12 years but I started web developing a bit earlier as I have
                        better plans for future. I learnt web developing from an app named <span
                              class="color">Programming Hero</span>. It is an amazing app to start your programming
                        journey.</p>

                  <h4><span class="blue">Become a Software Engineer</span></h4>
                  <p> I learnt HTML and CSS. I mainly learnt Python as my base language but along with that I also
                        learnt these two languages. Now I can build a simple portfolio website easily. I will try to
                        deploy websites on different topics after learning JavaScript.You can communicate with me by
                        using the email address given below: </p>

                  <h4 style="color:purple;"> 2020-Present l Pro Level Developer</h4>
                  <p> I am the master of HTML and CSS. I know almost everything to build a website. I really became
                        interested in web developing because I find it interesting. Besides, these two languages are
                        very easy to learn. If anyone of you guys want to learn web developing you can start with HTML.
